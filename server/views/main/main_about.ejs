              About DomaHub
            </h1>
            <p>
              Our mission is to change the current perception of domains
              as purely buy-and-sell commodities and re-imagine them as
              valuable assets similar to real estate properties. Our platform
              strives to make unused domain names accessible to anyone who may have a
              use for them.
            </p>
            <p>
              DomaHub is committed to providing inexpensive domain name rentals
              at flexible time slots as well as creating a new revenue stream
              for domain name owners. Our dream is to grow
              into a business that can create significant benefits for all parties involved.
