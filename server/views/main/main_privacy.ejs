              The following Privacy Policy establishes and describes how we handle and
              use the information we collect when you visit and use our website, services,
              products, and content (AKA our "Services").
            </p>

            <h2 class="is-bold">What we may collect</h2>
            <p>
              Read our <a href="/privacy" class="orange-link">Privacy Policy</a> to understand
              how we handle the data and information you provide to us when you use DomaHub and
              its Services. By agreeing to our Terms you also consent to the collection and use
              of this information - as described in the Privacy Policy - by DomaHub.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <h2 class="is-bold">Domain Rights</h2>
            <p>
              You own your domain - regardless of its listing status on DomaHub - until the day
              you decide to sell or transfer ownership to some other entity. At no point does,
              DomaHub assume or consider any level of ownership of your domain. Likewise, any
              renter of your domain does not ever gain ownership, even temporarily, of your
              domain name.
            </p>
            <p>
              By listing your domain with us, you acknowledge all the risks associated (be they
              unforeseen or otherwise). If you ever have a problem with the way a renter is using
              your domain name, it is your responsibility to contact us in order to create a
              solution. We will make sure all inappropriate usage is stopped as soon as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may list a domain on DomaHub that you have listed elsewhere as long as there are
              no conflicts regarding rental scheduling (i.e. a domain being rented to two people
              for the same exact time period), ownership, rights, or any other issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can remove your listing or even delete your account from DomaHub at any time,
              if and only if you have no current renters across your listings. Removing a listing
              in advance will cancel out the remainder of the listing's availability while leaving
              the current renters unaffected. DomaHub will keep your domain listed but labeled
              as Unavailable. You may reactivate your domain at anytime.
            </p>
            <p>
              We may remove your listing at any time for any reason (most likely you violating
              something or doing something wrong). On such an occasion, all current renters will
              be notified and refunded.
            </p>

          <div class="content">
            <h2 class="is-bold">Misuse of Domain</h2>
            <p>
              You may not inappropriately use a domain rental. For example, you may not upload, link,
              or otherwise display any material that infringes a copyright.
            </p>
            <p>
              Domain owners may exercise the ability to flag renters for inappropriate usage. DomaHub
              will be contacted and following an evaluation of the infraction from our team, we will
              decide the appropriate counteraction.
