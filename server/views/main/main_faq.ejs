                What exactly does DomaHub do?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Put simply, DomaHub is a platform allowing domain name
                owners to rent out their domains to prospective renters.
                It's a communication and advertising platform for sellers,
                and a browse and shop marketplace for renters.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                DomaHub receives money every time a Basic listing is rented out
                as well as when a Premium listing is posted.

                How long can I keep the domain?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                You may only keep the domain for the amount of time you paid for.
                You will immediately lose ownership and control of the domain the
                second past your allotted time.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                All extensions must be negotiated and purchased prior to your current
                expiration date(s). However, if the domain has already been rented
                for the subsequent time slots, you may not steal those times away from
                others just because you currently have the domain rented.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                Domain rentals through DomaHub are legally binded by contract
                and may not - under any circumstances - be sold while a user
                has rented it.

                How do I start listing domains?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                Once you have created an account and <a class="orange-link" href="/authorizestripe">
                verified Stripe</a> payments, you may create a listing by going to the
                <a class="orange-link" href="/listing/create">create listing</a> page.
                DomaHub offers two types of listings: Basic and Premium.

                What are the differences between basic and premium listings?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                A Basic listing is free to list, but has an 18% commission on sales.
                Basic listings have flat, fixed pricing which means DomaHub will decide
                its price. Additionally, Basic listings cannot be listed for hourly slots.
                A Premium listing costs &#36;5 a month to list, but DomaHub will not take any commission.
                Custom pricing as well as hourly pricing are both available to Premium listings.

                What happens if I find a buyer for my domain?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                You may not sell your domain while it is being rented by a DomaHub
                user. However, if your domain is listed but not currently being rented,
                you may cancel the listing and sell it as you please.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                No you cannot immediately cancel any listing that is currently rented by a DomaHub user.
                However, you may cancel your listing for all dates following the current renters'
                schedule; effectively removing all future availability.
