              <p>
                Landing pages help you sell your domain. DomaHub provides the quickest solution to setting
                up landing pages for all of your domains. We also provide management tools as well as secure
                payment processing.

                What's the difference between Basic and Premium?</h3>
              <p>
                Landing pages created on our Basic model stick to our standard theme and have a DomaHub branded footer.
                There is also a commission taken from sales made through our platform. On the other hand, a Premium
                landing page has no commission on sales, and comes with extensive custom features and modules.
