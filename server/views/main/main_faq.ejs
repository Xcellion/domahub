              <p class="faq-answer">
                DomaHub is a marketplace that allows domain name
                owners to rent out their domains to prospective renters.
                We aim to connect previously unused domains with potential users.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                DomaHub receives money every time a Basic listing is rented out
                as well as when a Premium listing is posted.

                Technically, the domain never leaves the ownership of the owner. Through DNS
                and proxying, we can point the domain name to whatever content you wish to display.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                You may only use the domain for the amount of time you paid for.
                Any content being redirected to that domain will immediately stop once your time is up.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                    You may add more time slots to your rental after your initial purchase. However, all rentals are final once paid for.
                    Please make sure to select the correct times before paying!

                    Once your rental expires, if the domain has already been rented for the subsequent time slots,
                    you may not steal those times away from others just because you currently have the domain rented.

              <p class="faq-answer">
                Domain rentals through DomaHub are legally binded by contract
                and may not - under any circumstances - be sold while a user
                has rented it.

                Buy-out options are currently not available through DomaHub. However, some listings may have

              <p class="faq-answer">
                  Your listing will not be active until you have connected your <a tabindex="1" class="is-accent" href="/authorizestripe" title="Authorize Stripe Page">

                  DomaHub offers two types of listings: Basic and Premium. Once you have created your listing, you must point your DNS A records
                  to our servers to verify that you own the domain.

                Why do I have to verify my domain?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                By pointing your domain name to our servers, we can verify that you are indeed the owner of the domain
                and that you are agreeing to our terms and services by listing it on DomaHub.

                What are the differences between Basic and Premium listings?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                A Basic listing is free to list, but has an 15% commission on all rentals.
                Basic listings have flat, fixed pricing which means DomaHub will decide
                its price.
              </p>
                </br>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                  A Premium listing costs $5 a month to list, but DomaHub will not take any commission from rentals.
                  Custom pricing as well as hourly pricing are available to Premium listings. Once a listing is Premium,
                  you will be charged monthly to maintain its Premium status. You may cancel the subscription at any point, however,
                  the initial month charge cannot be refunded.

                Why should I use a Premium listing?</h3>
              <p class="faq-answer">
                We believe that not all domain names are created equal. However, it's up to you to decide which ones hold the most value.
                Should you believe that a domain is worth more than the default rental rates offered as a Basic listing, we recommend creating
                a Premium listing instead.

                You may not sell your domain while it is being rented by a DomaHub
