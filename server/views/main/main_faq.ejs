              <p>

                up landing pages for all of your domains. We also provide management tools as well as secure

              <p>
                Landing pages created on our Basic model stick to our standard theme and have a DomaHub branded footer.
                There is also a commission taken from sales made through our platform. On the other hand, a Premium
                landing page has no commission on sales, and comes with extensive custom features and modules.

                You MUST verify your domain in order to use DomaHub's services. You may do this in your
                <a class="is-accent" href="/profile" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profile page</a> by following the listed instructions.

                In your <a class="is-accent" href="/profile" tabindex="0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">profile page</a>, you can
                access design and styling options for each individual domain name. If you choose not to edit these options, the domain
                will display our default theme.

              <p>
                Only domains on the Premium model have access to theme and design customization. You can upgrade your domain(s) through your

                Yes, you can set a domain to Inactive by going to your account dashboard and accessing the respective domain's settings.
                By setting a domain to Inactive, all payments are suspended and its landing page will not load.

                <p>
                    Not all domains fit into the renting business model.
                </p>
              <p>
                Look at a domain name and ask yourself this--"can this domain name be used by multiple people in a given year?"
                If the answer is yes, then it is a potential candidate for our marketplace. If the answer is no, then it probably
                won't perform well.

              <p>
                A lot of domain owners have a lot of domain names and this adds up to a lot of work over time.
                DomaHub is an automated system that allows for this to happen seamlessly and effortlessly for all
                parties involved with the right system of checks in place to make sure everybody is protected.

                Will this damage my domain "brand?"</h3>
              <p>
                It's easy to see how spam can damage your domain brand because the idea of "short term" rentals currently does not exist.
                But what if the idea of "renting domains" became more
                widespread and accepted? Then perhaps what you see on a domain or URL may not necessarily reflect on that domain's brand.
              </p>
              <p>
                  It's a very similar concept to a link shortener or URL redirectors. For example, there are millions of spam <a class='is-accent' href="http://bit.ly">Bit.ly</a>
                   shortened links, but when you see a spam Bit.ly link you don't associate the spam with Bit.ly's service or brand.

                What are the commission fees?</h3>
                <p>
                  DomaHub charges 18% commission from each successful rental. In addition to this fee,
                  the seller must also pay a processing fee for every successful transaction
                  (2.9% + $0.30) which we pay directly to our payments processor.
                </p>
              <%# <p>
                DomaHub takes a percentage based commission from each successful rental.
                Each listing falls under one of three levels with varying commission rates
                for each listing. Commission rates are based on the "Rental Rate" of the
                listing - the number of successful rentals divided by the number of total
                available rentals from the date it was created. In addition to this fee,
                the seller must also pay a processing fee for every successful transaction
                (2.9% + $0.30) which we pay directly to our payments processor.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if <span class="is-accent">example.com</span> has been available for
                60 days and has been rented out for 31 days, it has achieved Level 3.
                DomaHub will only take 15% commission from those rentals from that point onwards.
                Logically, all listings start at Level 1.

                All domain rentals can be refunded by the domain owner. If you discover a specific rental that you believe
                is malicious, spam, or illegal in any way, you reserve the right to cancel the rental and refund the renter their money.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, all domain rentals are screened using the official <a class="is-accent" href="https://developers.google.com/safe-browsing/">Google Safe Browsing API</a>. This way, we ensure that
                all content being displayed on your website has been deemed safe to browse by Google.
